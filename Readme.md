# Introduction to git and the command line

This course takes elements from the software carpentries [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
and [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html).  The aim is to provide learners 
with enough skills to be able to navigate the command line and use git to provide version control on files.
